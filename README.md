## Description
This is a weather app created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5 and jQuery. The user inputs any city in the world and is given the current Weather, including details such as Temperature, Wind, Humidity and the 5-Day Forecast.
<br />

## What was learned?
While working on this I learned how to use Bootstrap framework to easily create a very fluid designed webpage. I had also learned how to dynamically create buttons for search history using the Local Storage values from the user.
