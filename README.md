## Description
This is a weather app created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5 and jQuery. The user inputs any city in the world and is given the current Weather, including details such as Temperature, Wind, Humidity and the 5-Day Forecast.
<br />

## What was learned?
While working on this I learned how to use a third party API and retrieve data using user inputs. In this case we are using the OpenWeatherMapAPI to retrieve weather data for a given city. You can see the info recieved from the API by Inspecting Element on the webpage and navigating to the Console once a search is made.
